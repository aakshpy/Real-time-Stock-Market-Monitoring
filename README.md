# 📈 Real-Time Stock Market Monitoring  

 **Streamlit-based** real-time stock market monitoring app powered by **Alpha Vantage API**.  

---

## ✅ **What is expected:**  
✔️ Fetches **real-time stock data** for user-defined stock symbols.  
✔️ **Interactive stock market trend visualization** using **Plotly**.  
✔️ **Optimized performance** with **cached API requests**.  

---

## 🔮 **Planned Future Features**  
🔹 **Gemini AI Integration** – Forecast stock trends & provide **investment recommendations**.  
🔹 **Dark/Light Mode Toggle** – Improve UI experience.  
🔹 **Auto-Refresh Option** – Refresh stock data at regular intervals.  
🔹 **Sidebar with Extra Features** – Display company profiles, market capital, and more.

## ⚠️ **What to look out for:**  
❌ **API Rate Limits** – Alpha Vantage limits free users to **5 API calls per minute**, so exceeding this limit causes errors.  
❌ **Timeout Handling** – Currently, the app **does not handle** timeout errors properly.  
❌ **Slow Data Retrieval** – Fetching data **may take longer for uncached stock symbols**.  
❌ **Other Bugs?** Let me know! 😁
